# 🚖 Uber Data Analysis Using R

This project delves into the analysis of Uber's ride data from six months of 2014, sourced from **Kaggle**. The primary goal is to leverage **data storytelling** to help companies understand the patterns and trends in ride data, which can be instrumental in making informed business decisions. The dataset includes columns such as **date/time**, **latitude (LAT)**, **longitude (LON)**, and **base codes**, which provide insights into the specifics of each Uber ride.

By analyzing these variables, this project aims to uncover key insights, such as the **times of the year** and **times of the day** when Uber rides are most frequent. Understanding these temporal patterns is crucial for businesses to optimize their operations, allocate resources efficiently, and enhance the customer experience.

## 📌 Project Overview

### Key Highlights:
- **Data visualization** of Uber ride data over six months of 2014.
- Identification of ride frequency patterns by **hour of the day**, **day of the month**, and **month of the year**.
- Heatmaps and other visualizations to show the **distribution of rides** across time and base codes.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using libraries such as **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

The dataset provides detailed information on each ride, which is used to uncover insights such as the busiest times of the day and year. The visualizations and analysis help to answer key business questions, such as:
- When are Uber rides most frequent?
- Which base codes are most commonly associated with trips?
- What are the peak hours and days for Uber rides?

## 📊 Data Visualization

The project includes several visualizations created using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to showcase the trends in the Uber data. Key visualizations include:

- **Trip frequency by hour**: A line plot that shows the number of trips taken at different hours of the day.
- **Trip frequency by day of the month**: A bar chart depicting the number of trips for each day of the month.
- **Trip frequency by month of the year**: A plot that identifies the months with the most Uber rides.
- **Heatmap**: A heatmap that shows the distribution of Uber rides by day, hour, and month.

These visualizations help uncover critical patterns in the data and are key to understanding temporal ride patterns and demand fluctuations.
